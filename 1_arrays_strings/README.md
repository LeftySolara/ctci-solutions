# Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
2. Implement a function which reverses a null-terminated string.
3. Given two strings, write a method to determine if one is a permutation of the other.
